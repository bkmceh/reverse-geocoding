# reverse-geocoding

## üíæ Information 
This service receives the coordinates of a point, and if it is not in the database, adds it there.

The address is requested through interaction with the _DaData API_.

When re-requesting this point, the service takes the address from the database.

It turns out some kind of data caching.

### ‚ùì How to send request?
Request sends on address with _**lat**_ and _**lon**_ path parameters:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/address/get
```

Example curl request:
```
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/address/get?lat=54.741646&lon=48.734"
```

### ‚ùì What does the server do?
The server receives a get request from our client and first checks the existence of this point in the database.

- If it finds it, it returns:
    ```
    LAT: 54.741646, LON: 48.734
    Address: Found from Database: –†–µ—Å–ø –¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω, –¢–µ—Ç—é—à—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä-–Ω, –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–æ–∫ –ü–∏—â–µ–º–∞—Ä, —É–ª –ü–∏—â–µ–º–∞—Ä
    ```
- If there is no given point in the database, the server makes a get request to the DaData API, saves the data into the database and returns:
    ```
    LAT: 54.741646, LON: 48.734
    Address: Not found from Database, saved: –†–µ—Å–ø –¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω, –¢–µ—Ç—é—à—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä-–Ω, –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–æ–∫ –ü–∏—â–µ–º–∞—Ä, —É–ª –ü–∏—â–µ–º–∞—Ä
    ```
